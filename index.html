<h1>Project 1</h1>
<p>
<h3> C. </h3>
<h4> Issues with the current design. </h4>
      •	Buttons labelled B, *G, and M, for those unfamiliar with the building and/or unfamiliar with the words associated in English, these would be confusing.
</br> •	The buttons labelled ‘S#’ may confuse users not aware of what the ‘S’ stands for.
</br> •	The *G button does not light up when pressed.
</br> •	Queueing up several floors while the elevator doors are closing can cancel the whole queue and turn off all the lights of the chosen floors.
</br> •	The interface does not indicate which direction the elevator is moving.
</br> •	When choosing floors that the elevator can’t process at the time, the button lights either turn off immediately or flash twice then stay off. 
</br>       The difference in the meaning between those is unintelligible since the outcome is the same with the elevator indicating it cannot process that request currently. 
</br>       This could also be confused with the elevator not working correctly or has a malfunction.
</br> •	There is no light indicator for the open and close door buttons to show that request has been acknowledged if the action is not immediate.
</p>

<p>
<h4> Explain why it is good/bad. </h4>
      •	Good
</br> o	The interface has incorporated brail for the buttons, helping some disabled users.
</br> o	The buttons are clearly marked with their corresponding labels.
</br>
</br> •	Bad
</br> o	Buttons labels can be confusing.
</br> o	Not all button light indicators work properly.
</p>

<p>
<h3> B. </h3>
<h4> List your most common uses and other more rare uses. </h4>
      •	Common
</br> o	To go up or down a building quickly.
</br> o	To avoid using the stairs.
</br> 
</br> •	Rare
</br> o	Transporting patients via gurney in a hospital.
</br> o	Unable to use the building’s stairs do to disability or handicap.
</p>
      
<p>
<h4> Does the interface make doing those common things easier? </h4>
      •	The interface makes common use more tedious than normal due to having to 
</br>       interpret the interface upon initial use and spending extra time doing so.
<p>
      
<p>
<h4> What is the common sequence of actions? </h4>
</br> •	Interpreting/understanding the elevator’s interface.
</br> •	Deciding what floor of the building you need.
</br> •	Pressing the corresponding floor button on the interface.
