<h4> Issues with the current design: </h4>
      •	The buttons labelled ‘M’ and ‘S#’ may confuse users not aware of what they stand for.
</br> •	The *G button does not light up when pressed.
</br> •	Queueing up several floors while the elevator doors are closing can cancel the whole queue and turn off all the lights of the chosen floors.
</br> •	The interface does not indicate which direction the elevator is moving.
</br> •	There is no light indicator for the open and close door buttons to show that request has been acknowledged if the action is not immediate.
</br> •	When choosing floors that the elevator can’t process at the time, the button lights either turn off immediately or
</br>       flash twice then stay off. The difference in the meaning between those is unintelligible since the outcome is the 
</br>       same with the elevator indicating it cannot process that request currently. This could also be confused with the elevator 
</br>       not working correctly or has a malfunction.
</p>

</br>
<h4> Explain why it is good/bad: </h4>
      •	Good
</br> o	The interface has incorporated brail for the buttons, helping some disabled users.
</br> o	The buttons are clearly marked with their corresponding labels.
</br>
</br> •	Bad
</br> o	Buttons labels can be confusing.
</br> o	Not all button light indicators work properly.
</p>

<h3> B. </h3>
<h4> List your most common uses and other more rare uses: </h4>
      •	Common
</br> o	To go up or down a building quickly.
</br> o	To avoid using the stairs.
</br> 
</br> •	Rare
</br> o	Transporting patients via gurney in a hospital.
</br> o	Unable to use the building’s stairs do to disability or handicap.
</p>
      
<p>
</br>
<h4> Does the interface make doing those common things easier? </h4>
      •	The interface makes common use more tedious than normal due to having to 
</br>       interpret the interface upon initial use and spending extra time doing so.
<p>
      
<p>
</br>
<h4> What is the common sequence of actions? </h4>
      •	Interpreting/understanding the elevator’s interface.
</br> •	Deciding what floor of the building you need.
</br> •	Pressing the corresponding floor button on the interface.
</p>

<p>
</br>
<h4> How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work? </h4>
      •	The buttons have floor labels that are a distinct different color compared to 
</br>       the metal frame and are put to the side of each button to clearly indicate which button is for which floor.
</p>

<p>
</br>
<h4> How does the elevator provide feedback to the user? </h4>
      •	If queueing up more than one floor, the button lights stay on to indicate the floor request has been processed and will proceed to that floor.
</br> •	The buttons either turn off immediately, or flash then stay off, instead of staying on when pressed when choosing a floor 
</br>       that is in the opposite direction the elevator is currently moving. This indicates it is unable to process that request 
</br>       at that time due to the current direction it is moving. This is determined through repeated use of the interface to 
</br>       confirm the buttons do work when processed correctly and are not malfunctioning.
</br> •	When a light turns off a while after having been chosen, it indicates the floor has been reached.
</p>

<p>
</br>
<h4> What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design? </h4>
      •	You could confuse the ground floor with being floor S1 since it is common to consider the 1st floor to be the ground floor.
</br> •	Try to pick a floor that is going in the opposite direction the elevator is currently moving in and be denied.
