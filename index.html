<h1>Project 1</h1>
<p>
<h3> C. </h3>
<h4> Issues with the current design. </h4>
      •	Buttons labelled B, *G, and M, for those unfamiliar with the building and/or unfamiliar with the words associated in English, these would be confusing.
</br> •	The buttons labelled ‘S#’ may confuse users not aware of what the ‘S’ stands for.
</br> •	The *G button does not light up when pressed.
</br> •	Queueing up several floors while the elevator doors are closing can cancel the whole queue and turn off all the lights of the chosen floors.
</br> •	The interface does not indicate which direction the elevator is moving.
</br> •	When choosing floors that the elevator can’t process at the time, the button lights either turn off immediately or flash twice then stay off. 
</br> The difference in the meaning between those is unintelligible since the outcome is the same with the elevator indicating it cannot process that request currently. This could also be confused with the elevator not working correctly or has a malfunction.
</br> •	There is no light indicator for the open and close door buttons to show that request has been acknowledged if the action is not immediate.
</p>

<h4> Explain why it is good/bad </h4>
•	Good
</br> o	The interface has incorporated brail for the buttons, helping some disabled users.
</br> o	The buttons are clearly marked with their corresponding labels.
</br> •	Bad
</br> o	Buttons labels can be confusing.
</br> o	Not all button light indicators work properly.
